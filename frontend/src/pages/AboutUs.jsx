        <p>
          Founded in 2026, <strong>TrioFit</strong> started with a simple idea: Why
          should you have to choose between looking classic and feeling
          comfortable? We noticed that traditional fashion was too stiff, and
          modern tech-wear was too "sporty" for everyday life.

            <h3>The Classic Style</h3>
            <p>
              We use timeless silhouettes—the blazers, chinos, and essential
              tees—that never go out of fashion.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h3>The Modern Tech</h3>
            <p>
              Our fabrics are infused with sweat-wicking, 4-way stretch, and
              temperature-regulating technology.
